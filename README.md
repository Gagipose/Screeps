# Screeps AI Experiment

I'm using [Screeps](https://screeps.com) to figure out the right balance for using AI in coding.

## The Goal

Finding that sweet spot between:
- 🤖 **Too much AI** → Not learning, just copying
- 🧠 **Too little AI** → Getting stuck, wasting time

```
Too Little AI          Just Right          Too Much AI
     |                     |                    |
  Stuck ────────────── Learning ─────────── Copying
```

## What I'm Doing

Writing code for Screeps (a game where you code your units) and using AI to:
- Get unstuck when I'm stuck
- Learn new concepts
- Speed up boring parts
- But still write and understand the code myself

## Current Status

Just getting started! 🚀
